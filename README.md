# Mint File Batch Renamer

> A simple batch file renamer build with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) & [React](https://react.dev/)

> **Important**: This is a practice program I used to teach myself about Tauri, but it doesn't take full advantage of Tauri's capabilities, and it's important to note that the current Alpha version may have some bugs and UI inconsistencies
