# Mint File Batch Renamer

> A simple batch file renamer build with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) & [React](https://react.dev/)

> **Important**: This is a practice program I used to teach myself about Tauri, but it doesn't take full advantage of Tauri's capabilities, and it's important to note that the current Alpha version may have some bugs and UI inconsistencies

> **Notice**: This app works better with Windows 10 (Version 1803) and all later versions of Windows. However, this program should be able to run on any Windows that has the WebView2 component installed, and unexpected behaviors may occur in this case. These issues will not be tracked or fixed.

## Feature

- Portable version, no installation required.
- Supports batch file sorting, filtering, and renaming in a single program.
- Supports workflow processing, connects multiple runners, and can build complex filtering and renaming logic to better manage your files.
- Built-in workflow manage, save & reuse your workflow.
- Comes with enough tools to cover everyday use.
- Multi-language support.

## Upcoming

- Supports custom filters and renaming functions
